    "expOfIntParagraph3": "The primary goal of the Arrima platform is to streamline and expedite the processing of immigration applications while seeking to better align potential candidates with the current needs of the Quebec labor market. The term (arrima) reflects the intention to harmonize the supply and demand for skilled labor. Prior to the introduction of Arrima, Quebec used a paper-based application system for selecting immigration candidates, a process that often resulted in significant processing delays and did not allow for agile responses to the immediate labor market needs.",
    "expOfIntParagraph4": "Today, the Arrima platform is primarily used by the government of Quebec to manage EOI submissions under the PRTQ. Additionally, it is being gradually expanded to include other application services related to various economic immigration programs, such as the Quebec Experience Program (PEQ) for temporary workers and international students. This expansion demonstrates Quebec's commitment to attracting and retaining a diverse pool of skilled talent.",
